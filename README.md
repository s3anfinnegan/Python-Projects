# Python-Projects
These are some weekend projects that I have been building using Python and open source material such as OpenCV and Google libraries. I'm pretty interested in the 
applications of AI as aids in everyday life like applying CV to electric gates for facial or registration plate recognition. I'm using Python as I want to work a bit more with electronics (Arduino and Raspberry Pi) for future projects and Python is super easy to script with.

Feel free to reach out to me @s3anfinnegan on Twitter or Se√°n Finnegan on LinkedIn if you have any questions about the projects!
