## Building AI applications with Python
These are some weekend projects that I am building using Python and open source material such as OpenCV and Google libraries. I'm pretty interested in the 
applications of AI as aids in everyday life like applying CV to electric gates for facial or registration plate recognition. I'm using Python as I want to work a bit more with electronics (Arduino and Raspberry Pi) for future projects and Python is super easy to script with.

### What am I building rn?
I'm training a face detection script to recognise users (training it with me and my housemates). The idea is that eventually the script will be able to recognise each of us.

### Reach me
